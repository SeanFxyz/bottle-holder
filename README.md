# Bottle Holder
This is a customizable design for a stand that holds squeeze bottles upside-down so the contents are always easy to squeeze out.
It is basically a little table with equally spaced out holes in the top, and it is very easy to customize because of how the SCAD script is written.
You can basically plug in the number of rows and columns of holes, the spacing between them, the height, etc. in the OpenSCAD customizer panel and the stand basically designs itself from there.
